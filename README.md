SEA D49 Create a Framework
===============================

A lightweight framework that populates the writeHead {'content-type': 'text/plain'} for GET requests

Additioanlly, processes POST data, saving chunk to req.body and adding writeHead {'content-type': 'text/plain'}

Conveniently, you do not need to add 'new' when starting a new router.
